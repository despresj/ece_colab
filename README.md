## Neural Network Project

The goal here is to generate additional data samples from a structured dataset using a generative advasarial Network. 

give it a go

# Replication instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/despresj/ece_colab.git
# install project requirements
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deliverables

1. Start to fininsh project, 
- [x] All the code wrapped in function
- [x] A testing procedure
- [ ] graphics and stats
- [ ] Make this repo presentable
	- [ ] Brief introduction of your project.
	- [ ] A figure that provides an overview of your proposed approach.
	- [ ] How to run your codes so that others can easily duplicate what you did.
	- [ ] Show your evaluation results.
2. A slide deck
3. A confrence styly poster


## Timeline and Benchmarks

- [x]  Mar-13: Prep data, debug GAN and outline model
- [x]  Mar-20: validate generated data
- [x]  Mar-27: set up tests, and impliment additioal function generating dataframes. Wrap all the code into functions. 
- [x]  Apr-03: This mostly works for now. Really just pending quality checks.
- [ ]  Apr-10: Ensure data can flow from start to finish. Make a list of all the arbitrary design decisions. Draft poster and slide deck
- [ ]  Apr-17: push the limits of the model and eek out as much performance as possible
- [ ]  Apr-24:
- [ ]  Apr-26: presentation day
