## Neural Network Project

The goal here is to generate additional data samples from a structured dataset using a generative advasarial Network. 

give it a go

# Replication instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/despresj/ece_colab.git
# install project requirements
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deliverables

1. Start to fininsh project, 
- All the guts wrapped in functions
- A justifyable testing procedure
- We can do this by training on and generating rows or dataframes, we should have both methods implimented.
- Make this repo presentable
2. A slide deck
3. A report
4. A poster made


## Timeline and Benchmarks

- [x]  Mar-13: Prep data, debug GAN and outline model
- [x]  Mar-20: validate generated data
- [x]  Mar-27: set up tests, and impliment additioal function generating dataframes. Wrap all the code into functions. 
- [x]  Apr-03: This mostly works for now. Really just pending quality checks.
- [ ]  Apr-10: Ensure data can flow from start to finish. Make a list of all the arbitrary design decisions. Draft poster and slide deck
- [ ]  Apr-17: push the limits of the model and eek out as much performance as possible
- [ ]  Apr-24:
