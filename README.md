## Neural Network Project

The goal here is to generate additional data samples from a structured dataset using a generative advasarial Network. 

give it a go
```
git clone https://github.com/despresj/ece_colab.git
```

## Timeline and Benchmarks

- [x]  Mar-13: Prep data, debug GAN and outline model
- [ ]  Mar-20: validate generated data
- [ ]  Mar-27: train various models using generated data and compare accracy
- [ ]  Apr-03: Draft report and work out a delivarable project
- [ ]  Apr-10: Tweak models and attempt to imporve
- [ ]  Apr-17: push the limits of the model and eek out as much performance as possible
- [ ]  Apr-24:
